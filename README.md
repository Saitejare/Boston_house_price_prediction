# 🏠 Boston House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

A web-based Machine Learning application that predicts Boston house prices using a trained **Gradient Boosting Regressor** model. The application features a modern and responsive user interface built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and a **Flask** backend for real-time price prediction.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to estimate the median value of owner-occupied homes in Boston based on various housing attributes. Users can enter property details through an intuitive web interface, and the trained machine learning model predicts the estimated house price instantly.

This project demonstrates the complete Machine Learning workflow, including:

- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training
- Model evaluation
- Model serialization using Pickle
- Flask web deployment
- Interactive frontend development
